# SNAKE AI: Deep Q Reinforcement Learning :snake:

## Introduction:

Snake AI is an advanced project that employs the Deep Q Reinforcement Learning algorithm to teach an AI how to play the classic Snake game. While the AI learns, the project provides a real-time visualization of the learning data using Matplotlib, and the game itself is built using Pygame.

## Features:

1. AI that learns to play Snake using Deep Q Reinforcement Learning.
2. Real-time plotting of learning data with Matplotlib.
3. Game interface built with Pygame.

## Dependencies:

- Python
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Pygame
- Numpy

All required libraries and their specific versions can be found in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup & Installation:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yantavares/snake-game-AI
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the program:

```bash
python snake_ai.py
```

## Usage:

Once you start the application, you'll see the Snake game being played by the AI. A separate window will show the real-time learning data plotted using Matplotlib. You can monitor the progress of the AI and observe its improvement over time.
